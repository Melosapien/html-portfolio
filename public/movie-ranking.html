<h1>Best (Anime) Movies of all time</h1>
<h2>The top 3</h2>

<hr />

<h3>1. Interview With The Vampire</h3>
<p>
An all time favourite of mine. I've based my entire
aesthetic off of this movie.
</p>

<h3>Pulp Fiction</h3>
<p>
It's literally a cult classic, how can I not?
</p>

<h3>Jujutsu Kaisen 0</h3>
<p>
Even though it's an anime movie, it's a really good anime movie.
What's not to like?
